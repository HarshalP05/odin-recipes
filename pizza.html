            <li>1 teaspoon tomato sauce</li>
            <li>3/4 cup mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon oregano</li>
            <li>1/2 cup capsicum, cubed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons pizza sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup big onion, cubed</li>
        </ul>
        <dt>For Garnish:</dt>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Oregano as required</li>
            <li>Chilli flakes as needed</li>
        </ul>
    </dl>

    <h2>Steps for Preparation:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In 1/4 cup warm water, add sugar and yeast, set aside for 10 minutes. You will see the mixture frothing, this ensures that your yeast is active. This test is only for active dry yeast; if you are using instant yeast then skip this step and proceed to the next step.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, add the yeast solution, oil, and salt, and whisk it well.</li>
        <li>Then add wheat flour and mix well. Add the remaining 1/4 cup water.</li>
        <li>Mix well and knead it to form a smooth pliable dough.</li>
        <li>Keep it in a warm place undisturbed for 2 hours. When you check after 2 hours, the dough would have risen. Now punch it down in case of any air bubbles.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough to make 2 small pizzas. Roll the dough to a thin base and cut it out with a lid to get perfect circles. Prick the base with a fork to make sure of even cooking and to avoid puffing up.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 150°C (302°F) for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add tomato sauce and freshly crushed pepper, oregano, and mix well. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Grease a baking tray with a little oil and sprinkle a little flour.</li>
        <li>Transfer the rolled pizzas to the baking tray and bake in the preheated oven for 7-9 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the pizza base is ready, brush it with milk. Alternatively, if you want to bake both the base and topping together, then at this stage add the topping and bake at 200°C (392°F) for 15-20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Spread pizza sauce on the pizza base.</li>
        <li>First, add half of the grated cheese, then arrange the toppings - onion, capsicum, and paneer.</li>
        <li>Then add the remaining grated cheese. While you arrange the toppings, preheat the oven at 200°C (392°F) for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once both the pizzas are ready, bake in the preheated oven for 5-10 minutes until the cheese melts and the base turns golden brown at the edges.</li>
        <li>After removing from the oven, add oregano, and chilli flakes, cut into wedges, and enjoy! Serve Veg Paneer Cheese Pizza hot.</li>
